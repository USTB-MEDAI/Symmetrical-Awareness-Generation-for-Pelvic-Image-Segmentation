# Symmetrical Awareness Generation for Pelvic Image Segmentation

## Overview
This repository presents the implementation of Symmetrical Awareness Generation for Pelvic Image Segmentation, an innovative methodology designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of pelvic image segmentation tasks in the realm of medical imaging. Through the integration of symmetrical awareness into the segmentation process, this approach significantly improves the delineation of pelvic anatomical structures, thereby facilitating improved clinical decision-making and patient management.

## Research Context
Pelvic image segmentation is a crucial aspect of various medical applications, including oncological diagnosis, surgical planning, and radiation therapy. Traditional segmentation methods often encounter difficulties due to the complexities associated with anatomical variations and noise present in medical images. The current framework addresses these challenges by capitalizing on the symmetrical properties inherent in pelvic anatomy, resulting in robust segmentation outcomes while maintaining high precision and recall.

Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this method demonstrates superior performance in segmentation metrics, such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU), when compared to existing classical and contemporary segmentation models.

## Features
- Integration of symmetrical awareness to enhance segmentation accuracy of pelvic images.
- Comprehensive performance evaluation against various benchmark datasets, with comparisons to classical and state-of-the-art models.
- Open-source code implementation provided to ensure reproducibility and to support ongoing research in the field.
